To start the project locally, you don't need to do much. Just clone the repo and make necessary changes as you wish. One thing to notice is that the backend will require a seperate API key which you can get at <a href="https://rapidapi.com/420vijay47/api/youtube-mp3-downloader2/">RapidAPI</a>

There are no other enviroment varibles to change. It's easy clone & deploy without headache.
